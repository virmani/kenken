## How to Play KenKen

### Basic Rules
1. **Fill the grid** with numbers from 1 to N (where N is the grid size)
2. **No repeating numbers** in any row or column (like Sudoku)
3. **Cage constraints**: Each outlined region (cage) must satisfy its mathematical constraint

### Mathematical Constraints
- **Single cells**: Must contain the exact target number
- **Addition (+)**: Numbers in the cage must sum to the target
- **Subtraction (âˆ’)**: The difference between the two numbers equals the target
- **Multiplication (Ã—)**: Numbers in the cage multiply to the target
- **Division (Ã·)**: One number divided by the other equals the target

### Game Interface
1. **Tap any cell** to select it
2. **Choose a number** from the number pad (only valid options are shown)
3. **Use hints** when stuck
4. **Check solution** to validate your progress
5. **Complete the puzzle** to see your time and celebrate!

## Installation

### Option 1: Direct Browser Access
1. Open any modern web browser
2. Navigate to the game URL
3. The app works immediately - no installation required!

### Option 2: Install as PWA
1. Open the game in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge
2. Look for the "Install" or "Add to Home Screen" prompt
3. Click install to add the app to your device
4. Launch from your home screen or app menu

### Option 3: Local Development
```bash
# Clone or download the project files
cd kenken-pwa

# Serve the files using any web server
# Python 3:
python -m http.server 8000

# Python 2:
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

# Node.js (if you have http-server installed):
npx http-server

# Open browser to localhost:8000
```

## Technical Details

### Technologies Used
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - No external dependencies
- **CSS Grid & Flexbox** - Modern responsive layouts
- **Service Worker API** - Offline functionality
- **Web App Manifest** - PWA installation
- **localStorage** - Game state persistence (future feature)

### Puzzle Generation Algorithm
- **Latin Square generation** using backtracking
- **Cage creation** with mathematical constraint calculation
- **Difficulty scaling** based on cage sizes and complexity
- **Validation system** for real-time feedback

### Performance Features
- **Efficient rendering** with CSS transforms
- **Minimal DOM manipulation** for smooth gameplay

## Customization

### Adding New Grid Sizes
Edit the `index.html` file and add options to the grid-size select:
```html
<option value="7">7Ã—7</option>
<option value="8">8Ã—8</option>
```

### Modifying Difficulty Settings
Update the `cageSizeLimits` object in `kenken.js`:
```javascript
const cageSizeLimits = {
    easy: { min: 1, max: 2, singleCellChance: 0.5 },
    // ... add custom difficulties
};
```

### Styling Changes
Modify `styles.css` to customize:
- Color schemes
- Animation timings
- Layout proportions
- Typography
